So currently im just figuring out how I can design a game around gravity of massive objects, Right now I have
"neutron stars" that people can add to the game world that exert gravity on the "player". Values can be tweaked easily
just go in the files. I know graphics are super simplified feel free to replace them with whatever.
Just add your game objects to the level i.e player and neutron stars... I will think of other things to add soon. And if
you can come up with more efficient code please let me know.  Yeah so go nuts.
Camera is done.
Map is done.
I guess I am gonna work on a laser beam of some sort? We will see how that goes Lol.
